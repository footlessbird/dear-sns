## At a glance

### Why divided into front-end / back-end 'server' ? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Because the rolls are different.üç¥  
Front is to transmit mainly HTML/CSS and JS files.  
On the other hand, Back is to store and handle data from Front accordingly.  

## Getting started

### DB configuration

Before we start, please check [Sequelize's documentation](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/migrations.html)   

As mentioned in the document, edit `config/config.json` file as yours       
It should look like down below:

```sh
{
  "development": {
    "username": "Your DB username",
    "password": "Your DB password",
    "database": "database_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
                .
                .
                .
}

```

### ERD

### Association

A user can make many posts and comments; one-to-many => `hasMany`   
Little tricky thing here is generally a hashtag can have many posts. Let's imagine #love on Instagram
likewise, a post so in this case, we set both like below so      
`db.Post.belongsToMany(db.Hashtag, { through: 'PostHashtag' };`   
`db.Hashtag.belongsToMany(db.Post, { through: 'PostHashtag' });`   
Due to 'belongsToMany' association, we need to use `through` attribute to create new model `PostHashtag`   
You can also look up these associations [Sequelize's documentation](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/associations/base.js~Association.html)



## AWS

As we discussed, let's create two instances - front and back

![instances](./images/aws-instances.png)

In the process to launch an instance, if you have reached ***Step 6: Configure Security Group***   
Please add rules HTTP and HTTPS so that we can access it front side

![conf-security](./images/security-group.png)

### Installing Node & MySQL

Before installing Node on your Ubuntu or Amazon Linux whatever you have chosen, we should kindly update it as the newest version
```sh
apt-get update
```

then, please install down below for essential thigs
```sh
apt-get install -y build essential
```

We use Node 10.x version
```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash --
```

Once you have finished installation above, now we finally install Node
```sh
apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Now remember, as we have two servers, we need to do it for back-end server as well   
Plus, we should install MySQL ***only for back-end server***
```sh
apt-get install -y mysql-server
```
```
mysql_secure_installation
```

### Cloning this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/footlessbird/react-sns.git
```

After cloning, let's move to `/front` directory and make sure that we got both Node and NPM successfully installed
```sh
node -v
npm -v
```
after that commands if you see versions like so `10.16.0`, `6.9.0` then we are good to go

install all the dependencies
```sh
npm i
```

Exactly same for back-end but move to `/back` directory


### NPM build and start

before running server we need build it first
```sh
npm run build
```
now we can do below to run
```
npm start
```

![background](./images/background.png)
If you see it, it's running in background


![monit](./images/monit.png)
We can also check logs
```sh
pm2 monit
```
See more detail please check [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/pm2-doc-single-page/)

Same thing for back-end this time as wellüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### MySQL error handling

If you face error showing by pm2 monit in back-end server   
***Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server...***
Check [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50093144/mysql-8-0-client-does-not-support-authentication-protocol-requested-by-server)


### Sequelize setting
Let's move to back-end server `/back` and install below
```sh
npm i -g sequelize-cli
```

```sh
sequelize db:create
```
If you see `Database name_of_database created.`, we are good to go and please kindly restart the server

```sh
pm2 reload all && pm2 monit
```
You can restart server and monitor at the same time by doing so

![monit](./images/dbtable.png)
Let's check DB tables have been succussfully created

## Applying domain

To use custom domain, you might want buy one from one of domain sellers such as Namecheap, GoDaddy and many more   

### Route 53
Let's go to one of AWS services called ***Route 53***

![domain-1](./images/domain-1.png)
Click `Create Hosted Zone`   

Enter your domain in the `Domain Name:` box
![domain-2](./images/domain-2.png)

![domain-3](./images/domain-3.png)
You'll see your domain appeared, click your domain   

Domain where you have bought might have manage-option for your domain and there might be nameservers   
Please kindly replace them with things in the red box in the picture below

![domain-4](./images/domain-4.png)

Same page, in the picture above, there is `Create Record Set`   
Click it then you'll see the picture below

![domain-5](./images/domain-5.png)

In the red box, please enter your front-end server's public IP (IPv4 Public IP)   

Same thing for back-end server but back-end server's public IP (IPv4 Public IP) and very first red box `Name:` enter `api`   

If you want to use `www` like www.your-domain.com `Name:` enter `www` change `Type:` to `CNAME - Canocial name` and `Value:` enter your domain like `www.your-domain.com`
